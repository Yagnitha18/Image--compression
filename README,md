# Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This folder contains the supplementary code to my article Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on OpenGenus IQ.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental algorithms for dimension reduction and is a foundation stone in Machine Learning.

Mentioned in this folder is the code to one of the applications: Image Compression using PCA.

The input is the OpenGenus logo and the amount of variance preserved for different number of Principal Components is mentioned below:
